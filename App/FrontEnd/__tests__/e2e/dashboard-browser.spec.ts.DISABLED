/**
 * DISABLED: This file uses Playwright which we don't use per user directive.
 *
 * User explicitly stated: "chrome-devtools MCP is far better than anything
 * Playwright or Puppeteer can do. Always use chrome-devtools in place of those others."
 *
 * This file will be rewritten using chrome-devtools MCP in Phase 2.2.
 * For now, see __tests__/integration/dashboard-integration.test.tsx for
 * equivalent integration tests using React Testing Library.
 *
 * Future chrome-devtools MCP tests will provide:
 * - Real browser automation and visual validation
 * - WebSocket frame inspection and network monitoring
 * - Performance profiling (CPU, memory, rendering)
 * - Memory leak detection via heap snapshots
 * - Accessibility tree inspection
 * - Network throttling and offline simulation
 * - Screenshot/video recording
 *
 * See __tests__/e2e/README.md for more details on the planned implementation.

// ✅ Initial Load Tests → dashboard-integration.test.tsx
// ✅ Real-time Features → dashboard-integration.test.tsx
// ✅ User Interactions → dashboard-integration.test.tsx (basic)
// ✅ Responsive Behavior → dashboard-integration.test.tsx (classes only)
// ✅ Accessibility → dashboard-integration.test.tsx
// ✅ Error Handling → dashboard-integration.test.tsx
// ⏳ Performance Tests → Placeholder (needs chrome-devtools MCP)
// ⏳ Visual Regression → Planned for Phase 2.2 (needs chrome-devtools MCP)
// ⏳ Network Inspection → Planned for Phase 2.2 (needs chrome-devtools MCP)

// This file is intentionally disabled and will not run in test suite.
